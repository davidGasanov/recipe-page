## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS variables
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Refreshed my knowledge of the css basics which I haven't touched in a long time, such as media queries, chaining selectors and pseudo-selectors. Learned a couple of things about building semantic HTML structure, and which sections correspond to which tags.

### Continued development

I want to become more comfortable with vanilla CSS & HTML, especially things such as tables, since they are tricky to style. I would also like to improve in reusing CSS styles.
